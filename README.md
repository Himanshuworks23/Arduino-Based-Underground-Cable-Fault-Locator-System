# Arduino-Based-Underground-Cable-Fault-Locator-System


Underground cable faults disrupt power & communication. This project tackles this with an Arduino-based fault locator system. A sensor cable with resistors detects changes in voltage & current caused by faults & transmits data to the Arduino. The Arduino analyzes resistance changes to pinpoint the faulty cable & its location from the base station. This eliminates extensive excavation & facilitates targeted repairs. Future advancements could involve integrating additional fault detection methods & wireless communication for easier data transmission.
